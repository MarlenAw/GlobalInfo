<h3 align="center"> "Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP." - Error Fix </h3>


- Install http-server by typing npm install -g http-server

- Change into your working directory, where yoursome.html lives

- Start your http server by issuing http-server -c-1

- This spins up a Node.js httpd which serves the files in your directory as static files accessible from http://localhost:8080



<h3 align="center"> ++someVariable Vs. someVariable++ in Javascript </h3>

- <b>++x </b> -> (Pre-Increment) means "increment the variable; the value of the expression is the final value". 
- <b>x++ </b> -> (Post-Increment) means "remember the original value, then increment the variable; the value of the expression is the original value".

```
Example: 

var n = 0, m = 0;

alert(n++); /* Shows 0, then stores n = 1 */
alert(++m); /* Shows 1, then stores m = 1 */
```
